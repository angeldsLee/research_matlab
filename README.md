# ISAR image fusion

### Implement ISAR image fusion from different observing angles.
Carry out range alignment on backscattered data, and then implement phase correction. After extracting scattering centers, estimate aspect angle and rotation rate by using slope function and triangle method. Further implement image fusion which can promote image resolution in actual operation, thus obtaining more information about targets.

### Rotational velocity estimationss
* Radon Detection of Lines method, Azimuth Rescaling before is as below:

* Simulated azimuth rotation is 0.04rad/s, and estimated velocity is 0.0360rad/s, and the rescaling
result is as below

### Fusion example
* After rotaional velocity estimation and azimuth angle estimation , axis transformation , the result
of Fusion is as below, as can be seen , problem exists which needs to be solved
